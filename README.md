# Multi-scale analysis of the exhaustion of photovoltaic potential in Switzerland

This repository contains all necessary R code and data to reproduce the findings of our study concerning the solar energy potential exhaustion across Switzerland. The directory "Data" also contains the RShiny script used to generate the visualizations. The directory "Website Code" contains the HTML and CSS files used for the setup of the [website](https://geo.uzh.ch/microsite/geo454projects/Group6/), which illustrates our results.
